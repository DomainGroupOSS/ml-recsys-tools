# ml-recsys-tools

#### Open source repo for various tools for recommender systems development work. Work in progress.

#### Main purpose is to provide a single API for various recommender packages to train, tune, evaluate and get data in and recommendations / similarities out.

## Recommender models and tools:

* #### [LightFM](https://github.com/lyst/lightfm) package based recommender.
* #### [Spotlight](https://github.com/maciejkula/spotlight) package based implicit recommender.
* #### [Implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit) package based ALS recommender.
* #### Serving / Tuning / Evaluation features added for most recommenders:
    * Dataframes for all inputs and outputs
        * adding external features (for LightFM hybrid mode)
        * early stopping fit (for iterative models: LightFM, ALS, Spotlight)
        * hyperparameter search
        * fast batched methods for:
            * user recommendation sampling
            * similar items samplilng with different similarity measures
            * similar users sampling
            * evaluation by sampling and ranking      
                  
* #### Additional recommender models:
    * ##### Similarity based:
        * cooccurence (items, users)
        * generic similarity based (can be used for with external features)  
              
* #### Ensembles:
    * subdivision based (multiple recommenders each on subset of data - e.g. geographical region):
        * geo based: simple grid, equidense grid, geo clustering
        * LightFM and cooccurrence based
    * combination based - combining recommendations from multiple recommenders
    * similarity combination based - similarity based recommender on similarities from multiple recommenders
    * cascade ensemble 
           
* #### Interaction dataframe and sparse matrix handlers / builders:
    * sampling, data splitting,
    * external features matrix creation (additional item features),
        with feature engineering: binning / one*hot encoding (via pandas_sklearn)
    * evaluation and ranking helpers
    * handlers for observations coupled with external features and features with geo coordinates
    * mappers for geo features, observations, recommendations, similarities etc.
        
* #### Evaluation utils:
    * score reports on lightfm metrics (AUC, precision, recall, reciprocal)
    * n-DCG, and n-MRR metrics, n-precision / recall
    * references: best possible ranking and chance ranking

* #### Utilities:
    * hyperparameter tuning utils (by skopt)
    * similarity calculation helpers (similarities, dot, top N, top N on sparse)
    * parallelism utils
    * sklearn transformer extenstions (for feature engineering)
    * google maps util for displaying geographical data
    * logging, debug printouts decorators and other isntrumentation and inspection tools
    * pandas utils
    * data helpers: redis, s3

* #### Examples:
    * a basic example on movielens 1M demonstrating:
        * basic data ingestion without any item/user features
        * LightFM recommender:
            fit, evaluation, early stopping,
            hyper-param search, recommendations, similarities
        * Cooccurrence recommender
        * Two combination ensembles (Ranks and Simils)

* #### Still to add:
    * more examples
    * much more comments and docstrings
    * more tests
